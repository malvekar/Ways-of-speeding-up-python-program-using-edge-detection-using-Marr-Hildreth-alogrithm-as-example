# Ways-of-speeding-up-python-program-using-edge-detection-using-Marr-Hildreth-alogrithm-as-example
This is a python mini project where Edge detection algorithm was implemented in different ways, with an intent of reducing the execution time.


# About 
This project was initially started as an edge detection project using Marr Hildreth algorith. The code used to work for small images, but took a long time for large images. So we researched and found the concept of multiprocessing. We slightly changed the project design and implemented multiprocessing. The speed increased considerably  Later we decided to upgrade our project to live edge dection. Since most of the code was written from scratch it was not fast and optimised.
